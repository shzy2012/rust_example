Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in std::fmt some of which include:

format!: write formatted text to String
print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
println!: same as print! but a newline is appended.
eprint!: same as format! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
eprintln!: same as eprint!but a newline is appended.

fn main() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Without a suffix, 31 becomes an i32. You can change what type 31 is
    // by providing a suffix. The number 31i64 for example has the type i64.

    // There are various optional patterns this works with. Positional
    // arguments can be used.
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.
    println!(
        "{subject} {verb} {object}",
        object = "the lazy dog",
        subject = "the quick brown fox",
        verb = "jumps over"
    );

    // Special formatting can be specified after a `:`.
    println!(
        "{} of {:b} people know binary, the other half doesn't",
        1, 2
    );

    // You can right-align text with a specified width. This will output
    // "     1". 5 white spaces and a "1".
    println!("{number:>width$}", number = 1, width = 6);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes. This will output "000001".
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number = 1, width = 6);
